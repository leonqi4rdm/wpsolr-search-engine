= Notice of deprecation =

From version 20.0, the free plugin will not be supported or updated any more.

For a while, the number of active installations has not increased, despite an increasing number of downloads.
This is a sure sign that people trying the free plugin do not have the technical skills to set it up, or customize it, to their needs. Despite our answers to every forum support question.

So, we decided to concentrate on helping users with our <a href="https://www.wpsolr.com/">WPSOLR PRO plugin</a>.

= Former description =
100% free plugin to search and filter in millions of post types.

No subscription on a remote service required.

Respects privacy: your data stays on your server.

Works transparently with your self hosted free <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a> and free <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> server. Just install <a href="https://www.wpsolr.com/guide/configuration-step-by-step-schematic/install-elasticsearch/">Elasticsearch</a> or <a href="https://www.wpsolr.com/guide/configuration-step-by-step-schematic/install-apache-solr/">Apache Solr</a>, the plugin takes care of the rest.

= Search is everything =
Search is everything and everywhere today. Yahoo directory was king, until Google came with it's incredible search technology. Can you imagine how you would manage without it ?
Your visitors, your future customers, expect a search as good as Google, Amazon, or eBay. And if you cannot provide it, they'll just flee to your competitors.
<a href="https://www.wpsolr.com/pricing?org=wordpress&cmp=search_is_everything">Yes, search is fundamental to my business</a>

= Your search without WPSOLR =
Visitors are leaving after waiting many seconds.
Visitors are shown the wrong results.
It cannot be adapted to the business expectations.
Some products are simply never displayed.
Those points remind you of your own search ?
<a href="https://www.wpsolr.com/pricing?org=wordpress&cmp=search_without_wpsolr">Yes, I want a fast search, accurate, flexible, and complete</a>

= Visitors bounce =
It's a very well documented fact that your visitors are waiting less than 3 seconds before leaving to your competitors.
Your search must be fast, really fast, under any number of products or any number of visitors browing your shop.
WPSOLR does that by using the mighty power of Solr and Elasticsearch. These are search software, scalable to any level you might require.
<a href="https://www.wpsolr.com/pricing?org=wordpress&cmp=visitors_bounce">Yes, I want to drop my visitors bounce</a>

= Custom relevancy =
This is a difficult requirement, because 'relevant' depends often on your business, or even on some specific search terms.
What if your results show relevant products, but the first displayed are 2 years old ? Not good indeed.
By using Solr and Elasticsearch, WPSOLR can provide you with predefined relevancy scores, or you can build your own. For instance, you could want to display relevant and fresh, or relevant and close, results first.
<a href="https://www.wpsolr.com/pricing?org=wordpress&cmp=custom_relevancy">Yes, I want to increase my search relevancy</a>

= Search millions =
WordPress search suffers from it's SQL inheritance.
It is fast with a few hundreds of post types, but brings your site to his knees after a few thousands.
The same can be said to most search plugins, that try to fix this issue with the same methods.
WPSOLR comes with a totally different technology, Solr and Elasticsearch, built from the ground to manage millions of data.
If your site is on his knees, it will not be because of it's search anymore.
<a href="https://www.wpsolr.com/pricing?org=wordpress&cmp=search_millions">Yes, I have an insane quantity of post types to search in</a>

= Search everything =
Any file (.pdf, .docx, .xls)
Any post type
Any custom field
Any taxonomy
Any WooCommerce product attribute
ACF fields
Anything you like with code
There is no limits but the sky.
<a href="https://www.wpsolr.com/pricing?org=wordpress&cmp=search_everything">Yes, I want to search in everything</a>

= Data privacy =
You probably already tried some pure search plugins, and some SaaS.
SaaS means that your data is sent somewhere outside your secured firewalls, to be indexed and searched.
It also mean your subscription is charged by the usage: quantity of data, indexing, searches. You could quickly be asked to upgrade to more expensive plans.
WPSOLR is a plugin, which requires Solr and Elasticsearch. But you can, and should, install those on your own server. You then get the best of worlds: your data stays at home, search is closer then faster, and you do not pay on usage.
<a href="https://www.wpsolr.com/pricing?org=wordpress&cmp=data_privacy">Yes, my data should stay on my server</a>

= Search engine optimization (SEO) =
Did you notice how Google shopping first positions are taken away by websites search pages ?
But neither “Yoast SEO“, nor “All in One SEO Pack“ do take care of your search pages ?
Fortunately, WPSOLR is also working hand to hand with your favorite SEO plugin to build beautiful search urls and meta descriptions. Search bots and humans will love it.
<a href="https://www.wpsolr.com/pricing?org=wordpress&cmp=seo">Yes, I want beautiful search urls and search meta descriptions</a>

= What WPSOLR can do to help my search ? =
Relevanssi, Better Search, Search Everything, are really great because they do not need other external softwares or services to work.

WPSOLR, on the other hand, requires Apache Solr, the worlds's most popular search engine on the planet, to index and search your data.

If you can manage to install Solr (or to buy a hosting Solr service), WPSOLR can really help you to:

* Search in many sites for aggregated searches

* Search in thousands or millions of posts/products

* Search in attached files (pdf, word, excel....)

* Filter results with dynamic facets

* Tweak your search in many many ways with Solr solrconfig.cml and schema.xml files (language analysers, stopwords, synonyms, stemmers ...)

= Do you offer a premium version ? =
Yes. Check out our <a href="https://wpsolr.com/pricing">Premium Packs</a>.

= Can you search in several sites and show results on one site ? =
Yes, there is a (Premium) multisites option in wpsolr.

You configure the sites belonging to the network search as "local", and one or several "global" sites to show results from "local" sites consolidated, while "Local" sites continue to search their own data.

As Solr manages the whole network search, there is almost no limits to the number of "local" sites, and number of posts indexed.
Contact us for more information on this multisites feature.

= Can you manage millions of products/attributes/variations ? =
Yes (Premium for attributes/variations). WPSOLR is based on the mighty Apache Solr search engine. It can easily manage millions of posts, and fast.

= Why the search page does not show up ? =
You have to select the admin option "Replace standard WP search", and verify that your urls permalinks are activated.

= Which PHP version is required ? =

PHP >= 5.4

= Which Elasticsearch version is supported ? =

Elasticsearch >= 5.0

= Which Apache Solr version is supported ? =

Solr 4.x, Solr 5.x, Solr 6.x

WPSOLR was tested till Solr 6.6.0
